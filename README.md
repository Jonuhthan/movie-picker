# Movie Picker ðŸŽ¦

Find something new to watch with this full-stack movie picker! Built with React/Next.js for the front end and Node/Express.js for the backend RESTful API, users have the option to view a catalog of current movies, have a random film chosen for them, or perform basic CRUD operations on the catalog. This project was created as part of Capital One's Summer 2024 Black and Hispanic Tech Summit.
